- Scientific notation
  - used for very large or small numbers;
  - numbers are expressed as decimals with **exactly one** digit before the decimal point;
  - all other digits are expressed as power of 10;

- Summation notation ("sigma" notation)
  - used as a shorthand for writing long sums of numbers/symbols;
  - very similar to for loop;
  - greek capital "sigma" denotes the sum, the two numbers below and above it denote the start and the ends points;
